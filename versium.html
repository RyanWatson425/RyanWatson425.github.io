								<h2>My Experience</h2>
								<p> I worked on a few different projects while at Versium. My first project was replicating the wordcount linux command through creating a script made with php. After that, I made an internal web application that analyzed which types of
									data were used as input, then chose the API that would return the most information with that data, and finally displayed all the data it returned on the website. For the bulk of my internship I was working on an admin feature that
									allowed the user to input a specific code corresponding to an API, then the form would request input depending on which code was entered, and then print the return data from the API call into an Excel spreadsheet. This feature was
									important to the company because it was able to use APIs that requested business data and consumer data, which previously had not been implemented in any other feature. I was later allowed to give a live demo of my feature at the 
									quarterly company meeting.
