							<h2>Project Details</h2>
							<p> Tyler and I set out to develop a downloadable application where you could play chess against a friend or the computer. My main contributions to this project were in the logic for piece movement and controlling the
								data structures that the data of the pieces were stored in. I had to solve many edge cases such as preventing pieces from moving off the board, special moves such as 'castling' or pawns moving diagonally, and automatically conceding
								the game when one player was in checkmate. Determining when a player was in checkmate was by far the hardest challenge for me in this project because it required me to traverse through the enemy piece possible moves and see if the king
								was in check, and if so, whether there were any available moves the king could do while in check. I have a <a href="https://youtu.be/23anIfAF03w">demo video</a> uploaded on YouTube to display the UI and piece movement within the application.
